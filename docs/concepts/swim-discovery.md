# SWIM Discovery

meshguard uses the **SWIM** (Scalable Weakly-consistent Infection-style Process Group Membership) protocol for peer discovery and failure detection. SWIM provides O(log N) convergence and bounded network overhead regardless of mesh size.

## Protocol Overview

SWIM operates in periodic **protocol rounds** (default: 5 seconds). Each round, a node:

1. **Selects a random peer** from the membership table
2. **Sends a Ping** (with piggybacked gossip)
3. **Waits for an Ack**
4. If no ack → selects _k_ other peers for **indirect probing** via Ping-Req
5. If still no ack → marks the target as **suspected**
6. After a timeout → marks the target as **dead**

```
 Node A                    Node B                    Node C
   │                         │                         │
   │──── Ping (seq=42) ─────►│                         │
   │◄──── Ack (seq=42) ──────│                         │
   │                         │                         │
   │  (if Ping to D fails)   │                         │
   │── PingReq(target=D) ───►│                         │
   │                         │──── Ping(D) ───────────►│
   │                         │◄──── Ack(D) ────────────│
   │◄── Ack(seq) ────────────│  (indirect probe)       │
```

## Peer States

The membership table tracks each peer in one of three states:

```
  ┌───────┐                    ┌───────────┐              ┌──────┐
  │ Alive │──── ping timeout──►│ Suspected │──── expiry ─►│ Dead │
  └───────┘                    └───────────┘              └──────┘
      ▲                              │
      └────── ack received ──────────┘
```

| State         | Meaning                                         | Transition                |
| ------------- | ----------------------------------------------- | ------------------------- |
| **Alive**     | Node is responding normally                     | Initial state on join     |
| **Suspected** | Node failed to respond, may be temporarily down | Ack received → Alive      |
| **Dead**      | Node confirmed unreachable                      | Suspicion timeout expired (30s) |

## Lamport Timestamps

All state changes carry a **Lamport timestamp** — a logical clock incremented on every state transition. When a node receives gossip about a peer, it only applies the update if the incoming Lamport timestamp is **higher** than the locally stored one. This provides last-writer-wins conflict resolution without wall clocks.

## Gossip Dissemination

Gossip entries are **piggybacked** on Ping and Ack messages — no dedicated gossip channel. Each message can carry up to **8 gossip entries** (configurable), each containing:

| Field             | Size | Description                                      |
| ----------------- | ---- | ------------------------------------------------ |
| `subject_pubkey`  | 32 B | The node this entry is about                     |
| `event`           | 1 B  | join / alive / suspect / dead / leave            |
| `lamport`         | 8 B  | Lamport timestamp                                |
| `endpoint`        | 20 B | Optional IPv4/IPv6 endpoint                      |
| `wg_pubkey`       | 33 B | Optional X25519 public key for WireGuard         |
| `public_endpoint` | 20 B | Optional STUN-discovered public endpoint         |
| `nat_type`        | 1 B  | public / cone / symmetric / unknown              |

**Total per entry: 115 bytes.** Ping and Ack also carry an 8-byte incarnation
after the sequence number so peers can detect restarts. A fully-loaded Ping
with 8 gossip entries is 970 bytes before the optional 187-byte org certificate
extension, still under the default 1420-byte MTU.

## Handshake Flow

When two nodes first discover each other through trusted gossip, meshguard
connects that membership data to the WireGuard engine:

1. SWIM receives a join/alive gossip entry with the peer identity, WireGuard
   public key, endpoint, NAT type, and optional org certificate extension.
2. Trust is checked against individual keys, org certificates, org vouches, and
   revocations.
3. The peer is added or refreshed in the userspace `WgDevice` or kernel
   WireGuard configuration.
4. Standard WireGuard Noise IK initiation/response packets establish the tunnel.

## Hole Punch Integration

When SWIM discovers that a peer is behind NAT (from gossip `nat_type` fields), it coordinates hole punching:

1. SWIM identifies a **mutual public peer** (rendezvous)
2. Sends `HolepunchRequest` via the rendezvous
3. Target responds with `HolepunchResponse`
4. Both peers begin sending UDP probe packets (`MGHP` magic)
5. Once a probe succeeds, the WireGuard endpoint is updated

See [NAT Traversal](./nat-traversal.md) for full details.

## Implementation Details

The SWIM protocol is implemented in `discovery/swim.zig`. Key design decisions:

- **Random peer selection** uses `std.crypto.random` for uniform distribution
- **Pending pings** are tracked with sequence numbers and nanosecond timestamps
- **Gossip queue** accumulates events and drains during message encoding
- **Event handler** callback notifies `main.zig` of join/leave/failure events for WireGuard reconfiguration
- **Atomic `running` flag** enables clean shutdown from signal handlers
