## 2026-03-01 - Optimize packet type classification\n**Learning:** In Zig, standard `switch` statements on integers compile to jump tables or binary searches. For highly skewed distributions where one value (e.g., data-plane packets) accounts for 99% of cases, extracting that single case into an explicit `if` branch before the `switch` avoids the jump table overhead and improves branch prediction. Furthermore, marking hot-path utility functions like `classify` as `inline` ensures the compiler eliminates function call overhead even across module boundaries.\n**Action:** When classifying network packets or events where one type dominates, use an explicit early return for the hot path before falling back to a `switch` for control-plane messages. Use `inline` for small, frequent classification functions.
